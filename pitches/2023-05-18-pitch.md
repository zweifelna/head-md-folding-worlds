As a psychopomp, your sacred duty is to guide departed souls to the afterlife. Today, your charge is a child, awaiting their passage  across the spectral river. This voyage demands careful handling, as you navigate the spectral river and protect the young soul in your care.

Embark on this solemn journey with three key tasks. First, accept the obol, the traditional fare from your young passenger, initiating their passage. Then, navigate through the spectral river using hand gestures to row, guiding the boat forward whilst shielding the child from any lost souls attempting to intrude. Finally, gently encourage the child to disembark at their new resting place, completing their journey and setting their soul free.
