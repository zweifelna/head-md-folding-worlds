# First day of workshop

- We formed a group and began to work on an idea for the workshop
- We started with the idea of an virtual world and an environnment we could manipulate
- We ended with the idea of making an autonomous world with rules and for the world inhabitants
- The world is set on a dirt bin, with paper animals, plants and humanoids that live their own lives each time in a different way
- We started to make paper assets
